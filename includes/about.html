	<h3>The Translation</h3>

  <p>The translation of Genesis used on this site is from the <a href="https://jps.org/books/holy-scriptures-tanakh-1917-edition/">1917 Jewish Publication Society translation of the Tanakh or Jewish Bible</a>. Based on the Masoretic text (a medieval edition of the Hebrew scriptures, created by Talmudic scholars throughout the diaspora and, to this day, considered the authoritative Jewish text), the JPS 1917 edition closely follows the late-nineteenth-century Protestant Revised Version, itself a lightly revised version of the 1611 King James translation. Though the language is at times archaic, it is relatively faithful to the original Hebrew. That quality, combined with the fact that the translation is in the Public Domain, made it the clear choice for our project.</p>
